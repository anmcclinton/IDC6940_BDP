# 2 Methods

As discussed by Brown (2021) and others, a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) is:

*a parametric linear model for clustered, longitudinal, or repeated-measures data that quantifies the relationships between a continuous dependent variable and various predictor variables. LMMs typically consist of fixed-effect parameters, which are associated with one or more covariates, and random effects, which account for variability across different clusters or subjects.*

In the context of this study, fixed-effect parameters describe the relationship of the covariates (such as age) to the dependent variable (MMSE score) across the entire population. Meanwhile, random effects account for individual variability across participants. This structure allows us to model both within-subject (repeated measures) and between-subject (individual) variations.

The dataset used in this study contains longitudinal data, where the MMSE score, our continuous dependent variable, is measured at multiple time points for each participant. Longitudinal data often require careful handling due to issues like participant dropout, which can cause later time points to have fewer observations compared to earlier ones. Alongside this, the hierarchical nature of longitudinal data makes it suitable for analysis using LMMs, which can model such structured dependencies.

## 2.1 Mathematical Foundation

LMMs rely on a strong mathematical foundation based on linear algebra. The general formulation for a 2-level longitudinal model, as applied in this study, is given by the following equation:

$$
Y = X\beta + Z u + \epsilon
$$

Where:

-   Y is the response vector, representing the dependent variable (MMSE scores).

-   X is the design matrix for fixed effects (such as age and gender).

-   \\( \\beta \\) is the vector of fixed effects, representing the population-level parameters.

-   Z is the design matrix for random effects (subject-level variability).

-   u is the vector of random effects, which accounts for individual variability.

-   Ïµ is the vector of residual errors.

    ### 2.1.1 Estimation Method

    We used **Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (REML)** to estimate the model parameters. REML was chosen because it reduces bias in the estimation of variance components, particularly for the random effects.

## 2.2 Assumptions

The LMM assumes:

-   **Linearity**: The relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable is assumed to be linear.
-   **Normality**: Both random effects and residual errors are assumed to be normally distributed.
-   **Independence**: Random effects and residuals are assumed to be independent from one another.
-   **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals is assumed to be constant across all levels of the predictors.

## 2.3 Implementation

The data were preprocessed to handle any missing values before fitting the models. All analyses were conducted using the `lme4` package in **R**, and model diagnostics were performed to ensure that the assumptions of the LMM were met. Graphical representations and visual diagnostics were created using the `ggplot2` package.
