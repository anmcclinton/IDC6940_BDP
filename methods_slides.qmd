## Why Use a Linear Mixed Model (LMM)?

-   **Purpose**: To model cognitive decline over time using MMSE scores in a longitudinal dataset.

-   **Why LMM?**:

    -   Fixed Effects: Capture overall effects of predictors (e.g., age).
    -   Random Effects: Account for individual variability across repeated measures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mathematical Foundations

-   **General LMM Equation**:

$$ 
  Y = X\beta + Z u + \epsilon$$

-   Y: Response vector (MMSE scores)\

-   X : Design matrix for fixed effects (e.g., age)\

-   β: Vector of fixed effects (e.g., age's effect on MMSE)\

-   Z : Design matrix for random effects (subject-level variability)\

-   u : Vector of random effects (individual differences)\

-   ϵ : Residual errors

-   **Estimation Method**: Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) to reduce bias in variance components.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assumptions and Implementation

-   **Assumptions**:
    -   Linearity
    -   Normality of residuals
    -   Independence of random effects and residuals
-   **Software: R (`lme4` package)**:
    -   Diagnostic checks to verify assumptions
    -   Visualized results using 'ggplot2'
